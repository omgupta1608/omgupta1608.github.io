    <h2 id="#tech">Tech!</h2>

    <p>
      I've been fascinated by technology ever since I was young. But the moment I decided to pursue a career in it has a
      different story. There was this one time in maybe 6th or 7th grade when I was sitting beside my mom and she was
      using Whatsapp on her phone. She wanted to send a file to someone that was on her laptop so she quickly opened
      whatsapp web, scanned the QR code with her phone and suddenly all her chats and groups were there on the laptop.
      This blew my mind and I just wanted to know how it worked. Obviously I couldn't understand a word about QR codes
      and APIs and stuff but I knew I had to study all this, if not, pursue a career in this field. This was the first
      time I became fascinated and interested in learning about technology.

    </p>

    <p>
      After school, I got a degree in Computer Science and did a whole bunch of stuff on the side, which was certainly
      not included in my coursework.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my coding journey with the PHP language, for a college-level project I was contributing to. The project
      also had a mobile team working on the android app. I quickly got interested in Android Development and started
      working with Java on a daily basis. I did android development for more than a year until I got pulled back to
      backend development by my ever-changing interests. But this time, I thought of trying something new, so I started
      learning NodeJs and I actually got an internship as a backend developer. In the meantime, I also tried React and
      Vue for frontend web development and kinda started working on the MERN stack without even knowing it. I also tried
      a bunch of other tech along the way like, NestJS, Angular, p5js, gRPC, GraphQL, Solidity (web3), Flutter and
      Golang. And guess what? I immediately loved Go. I slowly started shifting my primary work to Go so that I could
      write more of it. I eventually found an internship that helped me write Golang in production.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2022, I travelled across the country to attend a 36-hour long national level Hackathon, called
      the Smart India Hackathon, along with 4 of my friends. We won the Hackathon for the problem statement that we
      targetted. You can find the recording of the award ceremony <a href="https://youtu.be/5tUpqi4r6M0?t=3137"
        target="_blank">[here]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024, I tried giving Machine Learning a chance but didn't get really far. I started off with conventional ML
      using scikit-learn and studied Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines,
      Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc. It was fun but I gave up when I got to Deep Learning ðŸ˜…. I'll most
      probably give it another shot because from what I learned, the math is pretty cool.

    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I use Golang and Typescript on a daily basis and love them. I occasionally write Python and Rust in my
      current organisation as per the need. I recently got a Raspberry Pi and I've been trying to explore the ecosystem
      whenever I find time.
    </p>


    <h2 id="#projects">Projects!</h2>
    <p>
      Having a full-time job keeps me from working on more and more personal projects but I try to do some here and
      there whenever I can. I've listed down some of them (that I feel I am comfortable in sharing ðŸ˜…) here.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://omgupta1608.github.io/wasm-exif/public" target="_blank">[wasm-exif]</a>: A simple tool to
        view RAW
        image exif data powered by Go and Wasm.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/omgupta1608/cosine_similarity" target="_blank">[cosine similarity]</a>: An
        implementation of the cosine similarity algorithm in Golang.</li>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/omgupta1608/godash" target="_blank">[godash]</a>: Like Lodash but for Go.</li>
      <li><a href="https://omgupta1608.github.io/projectile/" target="_blank">[Projectile Motion]</a>: A simple
        demonstration of the Projectile Motion</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/omgupta1608/falling-sand-p5js" target="_blank">[Falling Sand]</a>: A falling sand
        simulation using p5js</li>
      <li>[Facpro - Faculty Progress]: An end-to-end ERP system we built for our college which included a GraphQL
        backend, a multi-tenant web portal using React and a cross-platform mobile app using Flutter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physics!</h2>
    <p>
      When I am not programming or playing video games, I tend to read/study physics. I am interested in a wide variety
      of topics in physics like Quantum Physics, Cosmology, Astronomy, Particle Physics, Relativity. I tried reading <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15852.Relativity" target="_blank">[Albert Einstein's Relativity]</a>
      but only made it halfway through (it gets real complex real fast). I've read some mainstream Physics books like A
      Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, The theoretical minimum series by Leonard Susskind, The Feynman Lectures
      on Physics (only Vol. 1 so far). I also occasionally write about physics topics that capture my interest on my
      blog.
    </p>

    <h2>Other things!</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from tech and physics I love listening to music and reading books. I recently completed Brian Cox's <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58587868-black-holes" target="_blank">[Black Holes]</a> and I am a
      huge fan of <a href="https://www.twentyonepilots.com/" target="_blank">[Twenty One Pilots]</a> though I am yet to
      attend one of their concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always been able to play the drums and other similar instruments even though I never took any professional
      classes for it. I think it's genetic as my father knows how to play some percussion instruments like Congo, Dholak
      etc. I recently learnt how to play the ukulele but I still have a long way to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love to travel a lot. I went on my first solo trip across Malaysia and had a great time exploring the urban
      Kuala Lumpur and the countryside in Melaka. I also had the chance to visit Vietnam with my friends (read more
      about it <a href="https://omgupta1608.github.io/blog/?id=9bcdfca0-ec59-411d-98e7-dcb39e79bf9a"
        target="_blank">[here]</a>) which I am definitely visiting again. Explored some beautiful places in India like
      Mount Abu - Rajasthan, Pondicherry, Mumbai, Rishikesh and Haridwar, which have no match.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I think that's a lot about me. Feel free to shoot me an email about anything!</p>
